## Purpose

In the chaos following Trump's inauguration as the 47th president of the United
States, I've set out to illuminate the fringe characters and dangerous ideas
that now sit within the inner circle of the most powerful man on earth.

This project aims to **document**, **analyze**, and **expose** the connections between the White
House, Silicon Valley, and far-right neo-nazi extremist movements.
